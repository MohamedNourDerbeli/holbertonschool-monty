# Monty Bytecode Interpreter

The Monty Bytecode Interpreter is a simple stack-based virtual machine designed to interpret Monty bytecode files and execute various stack operations.

## Overview

Monty is a minimalistic programming language that uses a stack data structure for its operations. This interpreter reads Monty bytecode files, containing instructions written in Monty, and executes the specified operations on a stack.

## File Structure

- **monty.h:** Header file with function prototypes, structs, and includes.

- **monty.c:** Main file containing the `main` function to initialize the stack and call the `file` function.

- **file.c:** Implementation of the `file` function, which reads and executes commands from a Monty bytecode file.

- **opcode.c:** Definition of the `opcode` function to determine and execute operations based on the given opcode.

- **push.c:** Implementation of the `_push` function to push an element onto the stack and `_strtol` for string-to-integer conversion.

- **pall.c:** Definition of the `_pall` function to print all elements of the stack.

- **pint.c:** Implementation of the `_pint` function to print the value at the top of the stack.

- **pop.c:** Definition of the `_pop` function to remove the top element of the stack.

- **add.c:** Implementation of the `_add` function to add the top two elements of the stack.

## Usage

Compile the program using:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
```

Run the interpreter with a Monty bytecode file:

```bash
./monty <filename>
```

## Supported Commands

- **push \<value\>:** Pushes an integer onto the stack.

- **pall:** Prints all the values on the stack.

- **pint:** Prints the value at the top of the stack.

- **pop:** Removes the top element of the stack.

- **add:** Adds the top two elements of the stack.

## Error Handling

The interpreter provides informative error messages for various scenarios, such as an invalid instruction, an empty stack during pop, or failed memory allocation.

## Build and Run

Ensure you have GCC installed. Compile the program as described in the [Usage](#usage) section and execute it with a Monty bytecode file.
